# ClassifierEstimator

#### Description
ClassifierEstimator: 
this research belongs to the field of Interpretable AI, which attempts to 
decompose and rebuild the input unknown sample, and observe the obedience 
of the sample to the trained sample space. If the obedience is high, 
then it indicates that this sample is within known domain, and the prediction 
should be of high confidence. Otherwise, it indicates this sample comes from 
unknown domain, the predicted result is under suspection.
