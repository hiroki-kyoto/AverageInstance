# Average Instance

#### Description
Average Instance is defined as the average look of what a concept can
be instantiated as. Especially, the visual concepts.
 
This research aims to contribute to open-set recognition, however,
it also demonstrate good ability to generate class specified random
samples with a big surprise. 
In the model proposed along with this idea, open-set classifier and
generative model are simultaneously integrated.
As an out-of-plan bonus, average instance is also proved to be
robust against adversarial attacks.
Besides, since average instances are learnt by clustering, they also
support a semi-supervised learning style.
